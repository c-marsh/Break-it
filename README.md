# 4. Testing

## 4.1 Validation

### [HTML5 validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Validates the code aheres to HTML standards

The HTML validator throws up a warning about a double hyphen in a comment, however as this is part of URL to copied code, I have left it in place.

//Screenshot of HTML warning

### [Image validation](https://validator.w3.org/)

Additional validation from confirms all images have "alt" caption.


### CSS validator

Validates the code aheres to CSS standards.

The code has been run through the W3 CSS validator.

It has thrown up some issues with the use of variables, however further research implies this is a feature not supported by the validator: https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111

Manual testing shows the code responding on the webpage as anticipated:



### [Contrast validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/)

The contrast validator checks contrast between text and background to ensure it's visible to people with vision impairments.

One issue was found on the site, but on further eximanation, it references a hidden form, and as such is not visible to any user.
